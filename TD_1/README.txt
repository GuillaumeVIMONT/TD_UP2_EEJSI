This is a basic experience to explain reservoir sampling with social edges.

Into the folder you have a data file with 100 edges and another one with 390 000 edges from a twitter capture on CNN.

Reminder : 

Reservoir sampling is a family of randomized algorithms for randomly choosing a sample of k items from a list S containing n items, where n is either a very large or unknown number. 
Typically n is large enough that the list doesn't fit into main memory.

This is an interactive python script, you need to specify 3 variables : 

1- Input file (in this case data_100.csv)
2- Reservoir sampling size
3 - Output file ( as you like, with a .csv)

After running this program, you can run gephi to play with the network graph.
